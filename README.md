## HW1: Circle and Rectangle

Directory: [HW1/](HW1)

This folder contains two basic geometry tasks:

1. HW1_1.py — calculates the area of a circle given a radius.  
2. HW1_2.py — defines a Rectangle class with methods to calculate area, perimeter, check if it's a square, and resize the rectangle.  

See the [HW1/README.md](HW1/README.md) for full details.

## HW2: Scopes, Closures, LEGB

Directory: [HW2/](HW2)

This folder contains ten tasks focused on:

- the LEGB principle (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in)  
- namespaces  
- usage of `global` and `nonlocal`  
- closures  
- an introduction to decorators (via memoization)

Tasks:

1. Built-in scope & shadowing (my_sum)  
2. Newsletter subscription manager (global + nested closure)  
3. Store orders with global and VIP discounts (nonlocal)  
4. Training session timer with adjustable rounds (nonlocal)  
5. Event calendar (closure + global events list)  
6. Calculator with closures (+, -, *, /)  
7. Expense tracker with global state  
8. User settings with closures (set/get/view)  
9. Memoization decorator-like function (Fibonacci or factorial)  
10. Product management with closures (update_price using nonlocal)  

See the [HW2/README.md](HW2/README.md) for full details.
